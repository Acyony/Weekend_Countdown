# Weekend_Countdown ðŸ“†
## Let's count the days until the weekend!

This repo contains a very simple exercise that I did about 10 months ago as part of the discipline I was learning at that time. <br>
	The whole idea is to create a mini-app that accepts the user name and returns a few things: 
* A greeting message containing the user's name;
* The current day;
* And how many until the weekend;
The task consisted of understanding and the usage of the Date class from the Javascript standard library. That was my first experience with that class, and I had to learn how to get the current date properly and format it in a human-readable way. 

In the end, I had to use conditionals to show a different message to the user according to the day of the week.

BTW You can give your contribution too. Any suggestion is more than welcome. ðŸ˜€
